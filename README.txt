This vars will let you change de form of the tree:
rdt_factor_angle1, rdt_factor_angle2, rdt_factor_branch1, rdt_factor_branch2.

They start with 1/2 but I recommend change rdt_factor_branch1 and rdt_factor_branch2 to random.uniform(0.8, 0.9).

Important: 
    if you use a very small reduction factor, you should change the min_branch_lenght too.

The colors are selected randomly
